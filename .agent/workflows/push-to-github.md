To push your latest changes (the HTML fix, 100+ startups, and documentation) to your GitHub repository:

1. **Stage all changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. **Commit with a descriptive message**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Fix HTML rendering, expand database to 100+ startups, and add README"
   ```

3. **Push to the main branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
